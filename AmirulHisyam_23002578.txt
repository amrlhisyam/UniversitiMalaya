My name is Amirul Hisyam Bin Amir Ruddin with matrix number, 23002578. 
I am majoring in Data Science. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. 
At the moment, I am feeling nervous and kind of excited about taking this subject. 
This is because I'm not that confident in coding but I am looking forward to what new things that I will learn in this subject.

I acquired C+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. 
So, I think I can manage to get A- for this DS subject this term. 
In order to do well in the subject, I will work hard. Wish me luck!!!
