1. Write a program to randomly generate N Students scores(0-100).
   The program will prompt user to enter N students and store the score in an array.
   Then, ,the program will display a list of score.highest, lowest and average score.

- create Random for integer scores
- prompt user enter N students
- create array of size N students
- create variable int highest, lowest and double average
- each iteration add into variable
- display 


4. Write a program that rotates 90 degrees clockwise a 3 by 3 matrix

- create a 3x3 matrix
- use random to generate number in matrix
- row[1] = col[3] , row[2] = col[2], row[3] = col[1] 

5. Write a program that generates 20 random integers within the range from 0 - 100.
   Sort array in descending order.
   Then, accepts an integer input from user.
   Then, search the array using this number.
   Compare the performance of linear search and binary search.

- create array of 20 integers
- use random to generate random numbers 0 - 100
- display list of the integers
- sort array in descending order - bubble sort
- scanner take input from users
- make linear search algorithm 
- sort in ascending order
- make binary search algorithm

Linear Search 
- loops array and compare using if 

Binary Search
- create variable middle, low, and high
- low = 0 and high = array.length - 1
- do while loop , this will loop as long as low <= high
- find middle using low + high / 2
- if search == middle, then break
- if not determine wether search is less or more than middle
- if less, high = middle - 1
- if more, low = middle + 1

6. Write a program that used to create Pascal Triangle in square matrix.
   Program will accept integer from users and use integer to create Pascal Triangle.

- Scanner to get number of row
- create square matrix, int[n][n]
