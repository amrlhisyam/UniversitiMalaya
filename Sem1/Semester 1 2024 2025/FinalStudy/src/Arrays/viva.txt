 a b c d c b a 

- expands outwards starting from middle
- what if there is no middle (even number of characters in a String)
-  

longestPalindrome method
- do boundary check
- get length of the string 
- check if length of string less than 2, just return it back
- loop through the string character by character and check if the character is a possible center of a palindrome
- 

expandRange method (s, start, start)
